I really like this minimalistic UI but I'm open on any suggestions and feedback :D

It's only design of project I would love to make but I don't havy any coding skills so it may be hard to do.

Let me know what you think about it! <3

I've created a special folder on Google Drive where I'll be uploading updated screenshots and materials related to the Lifa App project. You can find all the latest designs and resources there, as well as a link to the project on GitHub.

Hereâ€™s the link to the Google Drive folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-1uH47ot0RYKh328a6ZVoexX5cLIolZu?usp=sharing
